###Makes video chat a breeze

Introduction
------------
Liveline intends to make video chat less of a pain.

How do you normally video chat anyways?

Through Skype? We hate installations and constant, annoying software updates. Why not have it as a web application? Where updates are easily done? Skype also has the tendency to be really slow and the connection constantly breaks too.

Features
--------
- Fast, stable video chat
- Runs entirely on Javascript (No Flash)
- Standard library of Emojis :+1:
